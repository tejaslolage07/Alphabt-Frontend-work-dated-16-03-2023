# Alphabt-Frontend-work-dated-16-03-2023

Instructions for deployment:
1. Install flask and react. 
2. Run "npm install" to install dependencies in the React-Frontend/continental-web folder.
3. Run "npm start" to start a react server on the default port 3000.
4. Run "flask run" in the Flask-Backend folder to start a new flask backend server at the default port 5000. (In case these ports are busy, the urls in the code have to be changed accordingly as they are hardcoded.)

Things yet to be resolved:
1. The code is to be tested on the actual server for bugs
2. The time format has to be changed as per the needs on the backend server (if needed)
